# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning on Sales Dataset

This project is a step-by-step walkthrough of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python. Using a sales dataset, I demonstrate how to load, clean, and preprocess data, handle missing values, and explore patterns through EDA. The goal is to show how raw data can be transformed into insights using practical data analysis techniques.  

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- **Data Import** – loading Excel data into a pandas DataFrame  
- **Data Cleaning** – checking for missing values and handling incomplete records  
- **Data Preprocessing** – imputing missing numeric values (with median) and categorical values (with most frequent)  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – inspecting distributions and preparing the dataset for deeper insights  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
